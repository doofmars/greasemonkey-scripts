# greasemonkey-scripts
My collection of greasemonkey-scripts updated to work with polymer layout 2017

## old_vids_remover.user

Marks videos older than 1 week by with grey background colour.
Makes it easier to distinguish between new and old videos in list view.
Somehow YouTube adds these to my subscriptions and I already have watched and hid them.

## Watch_Later_and_Hide

Adds option for "Watch Later and Hide" to the subscription page.
Saves two clicks and movement of the mouse.
